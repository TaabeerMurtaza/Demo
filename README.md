# Demo
For my personal practice, do not download
There are 2 files in this project, one contains vendor folder which holds every third party library/package installed while the second zip file has rest of the folders.

To run the project:
1. Extract both zip files
2. Edit .env files and set appropriate database credentials
3. run: 
      php artisan migrate
4. Enjoy...
